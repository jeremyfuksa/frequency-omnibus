## Common UHF/VHF Radio Frequencies for BC125AT Scanner (Kansas City Area)

This document outlines common analog UHF and VHF radio frequencies in the United States, with a focus on those likely to be active or of interest in the Kansas City area. This list is compiled with the capabilities of the Uniden BC125AT scanner in mind, which receives conventional analog signals.

**Important Note:** The BC125AT is an analog scanner and cannot receive digital radio modes (such as P25, DMR, NXDN) or automatically follow trunked radio systems. Many public safety agencies in urban areas, including parts of the Kansas City metro, utilize these digital or trunked systems. Therefore, you will likely hear limited or no public safety (police, fire, EMS) communications on the frequencies listed below unless they still operate on conventional analog channels in specific areas or for certain functions.

### 1. GMRS/FRS Frequencies

The Family Radio Service (FRS) and General Mobile Radio Service (GMRS) operate in the UHF band. FRS is license-free, while GMRS requires an FCC license for most uses (especially higher power or repeaters). These frequencies are often used for short-distance personal or family communication.

| Channel | Frequency (MHz) | Usage | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1-7 | 462.5625, 462.5875, 462.6125, 462.6375, 462.6625, 462.6875, 462.7125 | FRS & GMRS Simplex | FRS max 2W handheld, GMRS can use higher power (license required for GMRS). |
| 8-14 | 467.5625, 467.5875, 467.6125, 467.6375, 467.6625, 467.6875, 467.7125 | FRS & GMRS Simplex | Limited to 0.5W for both services. |
| 15-22 | 462.5500, 462.5750, 462.6000, 462.6250, 462.6500, 462.6750, 462.7000, 462.7250 | FRS & GMRS Simplex / GMRS Repeater Output | FRS max 2W, GMRS can use higher power. GMRS license required for repeater use. |
| 15R-22R (Repeater Inputs) | 467.5500 - 467.7250 | GMRS Repeater Input | GMRS license required. (Scanner will only receive the input frequency). |

### 2. MURS Frequencies

The Multi-Use Radio Service (MURS) operates in the VHF band and is license-by-rule (no individual license needed). It's used for short-distance business or personal communication, with a maximum power of 2 Watts.

| Channel | Frequency (MHz) | Bandwidth | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 151.820 | 11.25 kHz | |
| 2 | 151.880 | 11.25 kHz | |
| 3 | 151.940 | 11.25 kHz | |
| 4 | 154.570 | 20 kHz | Also known as "Blue Dot". |
| 5 | 154.600 | 20 kHz | Also known as "Green Dot". |

### 3. Amateur Radio (Ham Radio) Simplex and Calling Frequencies (VHF/UHF)

Amateur Radio requires an FCC license. These are common frequencies used for direct radio-to-radio communication (simplex) or as calling channels to make contact before moving to another frequency.

| Band | Frequency (MHz) | Usage | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2 Meters (VHF) | 146.520 | National FM Simplex Calling Frequency | Primary frequency to call other hams on simplex. |
| 2 Meters (VHF) | 144.390 | APRS (Automatic Packet Reporting System) | Digital mode for tracking and data (you may hear digital bursts). |
| 2 Meters (VHF) | 144.200 | SSB (Single Sideband) Calling Frequency | Used for weak-signal and long-distance (DX) communication (requires SSB capability, not standard on BC125AT). |
| 1.25 Meters (VHF) | 223.500 | National FM Simplex Calling Frequency |  |
| 70 Centimeters (UHF) | 446.000 | National FM Simplex Calling Frequency |  |
| 70 Centimeters (UHF) | 432.100 | SSB (Single Sideband) Calling Frequency | Used for weak-signal and long-distance (DX) communication (requires SSB capability). |
| Various | Various VHF/UHF Frequencies | Local Simplex & Repeater Frequencies | Ham radio activity is often on local repeaters or other simplex frequencies within the amateur bands (consult the ARRL Band Plan and local repeater lists). |

### 8. Additional Analog Frequencies to Explore

These categories may have analog activity, though it varies greatly by specific location and agency.

| Frequency Range (MHz) | Usage (Potential) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 150-160 (VHF) & 450-470 (UHF) | Business Band (Licensed Specific) | Many businesses have their own licensed frequencies. Finding these often requires local databases. |
| 150-174 (VHF) & 450-512 (UHF) | Public Works, Utilities, School Buses, etc. | Some local government services and utilities may still use analog in these bands. Activity is highly localized. |
| Various (VHF/UHF Amateur Bands) | KC Area ARES/Skywarn Nets | Local amateur radio groups organize nets for emergencies/weather spotting on specific repeater or simplex frequencies. Check local clubs for details. |

To build the most comprehensive list for your specific location within the Kansas City area, it is highly recommended to consult online resources like **RadioReference.com**. You can search by county or city to find detailed lists of frequencies, often including information on usage and mode (look for "FM" or "FMN" for analog conventional).

Happy scanning!
