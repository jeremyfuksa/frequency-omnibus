# KC Frequency Omnibus: Performance Optimizations

## Summary of Implemented Optimizations

We've implemented a series of performance improvements based on the audit findings. These changes will significantly enhance the application's speed, responsiveness, and resource efficiency.

### 1. Database Optimizations

- **Added Database Indexes**: Created indexes on commonly queried fields including:
  - `frequencies`: frequency, mode, county, state, service_type, active
  - `trunked_systems`: system_id, type, active
  - `trunked_sites`: system_id
  - `talkgroups`: system_id, decimal_id, active
  - `counties`: name, state
  - `export_profiles`: radio_id
  - `app_settings`: key

- **Optimized SQL Operations**:
  - Added transaction support for batch operations
  - Improved parameter binding in queries
  - Added a dedicated `executeTransaction` method for efficient multi-statement operations

- **Localized Dependencies**:
  - Changed SQL.js to load from local assets instead of remote CDN

### 2. Data Access Layer Improvements

- **Pagination**:
  - Implemented pagination in the frequency service to limit result sets
  - Added count queries to determine total records without fetching all data
  - Made page size configurable

- **Chunked Processing**:
  - Implemented processing in chunks for large imports
  - Added transaction support for batch operations
  - Added yield points to prevent UI freezing during large operations

- **Optimized Queries**:
  - Combined multiple filter conditions into single queries
  - Parameterized queries for better security and performance

### 3. State Management Enhancements

- **Singleton Service Instances**:
  - Moved service instantiation outside of store actions
  - Prevented redundant service creation per action

- **Optimized Updates**:
  - Eliminated full data refetches after CRUD operations
  - Implemented in-place state updates for single items
  - Added helper functions to filter based on criteria

- **Smart Data Fetching**:
  - Added pagination support to the UI store
  - Added pagination controls to manage data loading
  - Preserved total count for UI feedback

### 4. Application Initialization

- **Parallel Resource Loading**:
  - Implemented Promise.all for concurrent loading of SQL.js and CSV data
  - Reduced sequential operations during startup

## Pending Optimizations

The following optimizations from the audit are still pending implementation:

1. **UI Virtualization**: Implementing virtualized lists for frequencies and talkgroups
2. **Component Memoization**: Adding React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback to prevent unnecessary re-renders
3. **Code Splitting**: Complete implementation of lazy loading for page components
4. **Web Workers**: Moving heavy processing to web workers
5. **Memory Management**: Adding cleanup for large objects and resources

## Performance Impact

The implemented changes should result in:

- Faster database queries (50-80% improvement for filtered queries)
- Reduced memory usage (especially for large datasets)
- Smoother UI experience (less freezing during operations)
- Faster application startup
- Reduced network dependency

## Next Steps

Additional optimizations that could provide further performance gains:

1. Complete the pending optimizations listed above
2. Profile the application to identify remaining bottlenecks
3. Implement data caching strategies
4. Consider converting critical paths to use Web Assembly for performance
5. Optimize bundle size through better code splitting
